# Description
 Our project is an app that recommends, (not prescribe) over the counter medication to people who finish a short quiz. Users will find out what illness (cold, migrane, headache,etc) they could theoretically have based on the provided questions.

 The user will get a recommendation (take a capsule of advil, for a possible headache)of what to take to solve their illness once they finish answering multiple questions that asks about what symptoms they have.

 It is important to say that these are only recommendations as a lot of people would recommend their families and friends these medications.

 We will not be releasing this app or link to the public because it could be legally used against us, if people take the medication on what we give them and it causes severe pain or incidents. We would in big trouble. So for now, if anyone has a stomach ache or headache, please do not only believe that medication will resolve it, it could be you just not drinking enough water or you slept 3 hours last night.
