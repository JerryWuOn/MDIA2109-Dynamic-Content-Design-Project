# Description
 Our website will be a medicine app. Users will find out what illness (cold, migrane, headache,etc) they have based on the questions we provide.
 The user will get a recommendation (take a capsule of advil, for a possible headache)of what to take to solve their illness once they finish answering multiple questions that asks about what symptoms they have. 
 Important: Once users open our webpage, they will get a warning with a disclaimer that we are not medical professionals and we are only recommending, based on labels from the over the counter drug.
